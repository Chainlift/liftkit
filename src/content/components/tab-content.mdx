# Tab Content

Tab-Content is just a div with flex-grow and overflow-y: scroll. 

In LiftKit, a tab component looks like this

```tsx
<Tabs>
	<TabMenu links={['Tab Link 1', 'Tab Link 2', 'Tab Link 3']}
	{/* But how does Tab Content get rendered? */}
</Tabs>
```

Here’s the thing. **You have to manually add each tab pane in the same order as the tab links.** You can render these tab panes however you like: dynamically, or static.

But the Tabs component matches tab panes to tab links based on their index. In other words, the first element you add after <TabMenu/> will be linked to the first tab link. The second element will link to the second tab link, and so on. 

```tsx
<Tabs>
	<TabMenu links={['Tab Link 1', 'Tab Link 2', 'Tab Link 3']}
	<div>This will become Tab Pane 1</div>
	<Grid>This will become Tab Pane 2</Grid>
	{someArray.map(item, index) => 
		<div key={index}>
			The first item from someArray will become Tab Pane 3,
			the next one becomes Tab Pane 4, and so on.
		</div>
	}
</Tabs>
```

As you can see, you can mix and match whatever component types you like. I mean, you probably shouldn’t. But yeah. 

**The recommended way to do this** is to iterate your tab content inside of some custom-defined
